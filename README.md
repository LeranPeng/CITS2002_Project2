This is a student collaborated project in an university unit CITS2002 2024 Semester 2.
This Project has been written by Leran Peng and Runzhi Zhao.

Developed a memory management system in C to simulate virtual memory and page replacement algorithms. The project involved implementing a virtual memory structure with processes, page tables, and RAM, simulating page access with least recently used (LRU) eviction strategies. Designed to handle multiple processes and efficiently manage memory using algorithms for both local and global page replacement. The system reads input from a file, performs page accesses, and outputs the state of page tables and RAM to a file. The project includes robust memory management, error handling, and efficient data structures to model a real-world operating system scenario.

We are happy to see someone learnt something from our project and hope it is helpful for you.
